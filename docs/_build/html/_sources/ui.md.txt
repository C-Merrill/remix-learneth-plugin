## Using tutorials

### The tutorial list

The plugin opens with a list of tutorials you can use.

They are grouped by the level of difficulty.

### Loading files

Sometimes a step will load a file in the IDE.

It is best to check 'Remember this choice' so you only see this window once.

Sometimes a step contains a solution to the problem. It will be displayed on the right in the Remix IDE.
